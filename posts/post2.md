title: Friction in the Process
---

We donâ€™t like friction, no one asks for more friction during a project.

Like a car at an intersection - when a car comes to an intersection friction is applied so that the best judgement can be made.

If you just drive through you may not be fully aware of any issues or see disasters coming up.

Friction can help avoid sending typos to print. Friction can help a project start on the right foot and avoid wrong assumptions. Friction can help a user make the right decision or better understand the one they are about to make.
